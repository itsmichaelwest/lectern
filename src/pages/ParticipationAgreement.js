                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                Thank you for agreeing to participate in my user evaluation study for my undergraduate dissertation project: Web-based video sharing site with timestamped comments. This is for the module CS39440 Major Project as part of my Computer Science BSc. degree at Aberystwyth University. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Confidentiality
            </h2>
            <p>
                I, <strong>Michael West</strong>, will keep all responses securely. I will retain the signed consent forms. These will not be shared with the University unless I am required to do so to demonstrate that appropriate consent was gathered.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data that is gathered during this study will be analysed and used in relevant sections of my dissertation.  Copies of the raw response, without any analysis, will be provided in an appendix in my report, as evidence that I have conducted this study. However, the data will be checked and anonymised before it is included in the report.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reports are read by members of staff in the University as part of the assessment process. Typically, this will mean approximately 3 members of staff. An external examiner from another University might also read the report.
            </p>
            <p>
                The original data completed by participants will be deleted when the module result is released in June/July 2021. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Withdrawal
            </h2>
            <p>
                You are entitled to withdraw your consent to use your evaluation as part of the study.  The analysis will be completed and submitted as part of my work by <strong>Friday 30th April</strong>. The report will be printed and bound up to three days earlier. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact me by 12:00 PM on <strong>Tuesday 27th April</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The department keeps reports for approximately 1 year and might be shared with other students and members of staff as an example of work from this year. If you wish to withdraw your consent after the document has been sent for binding and submission, it would be possible to request that the project is not used for any purpose other than assessment, therefore limiting the number of readers. 
            </p>
